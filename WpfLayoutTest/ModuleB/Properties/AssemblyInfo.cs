I have photos if you would like to see documented evidence, although I hope this will not be necessary.  I found the letter to be very accusing and not the service I would have liked to receive especially from a department entitled customer care." +

        "Items identified at completion are still outstanding which is very disappointing considering that we have now been in residence for nearly 9 months.I know parts have to be ordered but I cannot believe that it takes 9 months to find a replacement kitchen sink.")]
